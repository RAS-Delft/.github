This repo is the main documentation hub for lab users. 

The content of the /profile folder is shown at the ras-delft github welcome screen. A tree structure guides the reader into relevant sections further down the /profile/... folders. 
This is all done in markdown / readme formats so this can be read and updated through browser as well.
