# ResearchLab Autonomous Shipping Delft
https://rasdelft.nl/


## Organisation
We develop and investigate marine robotic control systems, housed at Mechanical Engineering faculty @ TUDelft. We conduct research ourselves and together with Bsc. Msc. or Phd projects. Our goal is to have a flexible, reliable and convenient framework to facilitate ever varying research or education goals within the TUDelft and her partners. 

## Facilities
- Various types of model scale ships, ranging from 40cm to 1m
- Various testing locations, controlled (lab/inside) and uncontrolled (larger sensor errors, more disturbance, more realistic sensing challenges.
- Components designed to be integrated in an interchangable framework, mostly ROS2 based.
- Various software modules such as , "actuator/sensor drivers",'Real-time simulator" or "control modules"
